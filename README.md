## Project 1: Investigation of Glucose Variability Indices in Type II Diabetes Patients
### I. Project Description
Diabetes has been the seventh leading cause of death in United States over the past five years, therefore, the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) of tracking real-time blood glucose level became an important indices to control diabetes progression.   

In this study we assessed the following seven glucose variability indices: glucose mean, glucose standard deviation (SD), glucose coefficient of variation (CV), time in range (TIR, % of readings in 70-180 mg/dL), time above range (TAR, % of readings > 180 mg/dL), time above range (TBR, % of readings < 70 mg/dL), and additionally, low blood glucose index (LBGI) in evaluating the effectiveness of two types of existed diabetic drugs (drug X, drug Y) in type II diabetes patients.

### II. Study Design
CGM data collected from 25 (out of 45) subjects in a single-centered, randomized, single- blinded, open-label phase IV cross-over clinical trial. Subjects were randomized to two group, with group A started drug X treatment in the first 12 weeks, followed by a 2-week wash out period, then started drug Y treatment for another 12 weeks; treatment for subjects in group B was in reverse order. Glucose variability indices were calculated in daily bases (per day) for each participant. 

### III. Statistical Analysis
Parametric (two sample t-test) and non-parametric test (Wilcoxon test) were used to conduct univariate association of drug effect and the indices. To take account for repeated measures, linear mixed model were conducted to determine the association of drug and glucose variability indices, allowing subjects to have their own trajectories. Carry-over effects and baseline parameters (Age, HbA1c, SBP, DBP) were also adjusted in the model. Wald test p-values were used to access the significance of drug effect and to check if carry-over effect exist in the model. Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC) was used for selecting the preference of random intercept or random intercept/slope model, with the lower the better.

### IV. Results
Using linear mixed model, we were able to identify five out of seven glucose variability indices that showed a significant drug effect difference throughout treatment duration using random intercept and slope model. Additionally, we were able to conclude that drug X performed better than drug Y throughout the treatment duration when evaluating the outcome using the identified five indices: glucose SD ($p = 0.001$), glucose CV ($p < 0.001$), LBGI ($p = 0.04$), TIR ($p = 0.02$) and TBR ($p = 0.02$).
